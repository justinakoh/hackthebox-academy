# Determine Login Parameters

You can use things such as BurpSuite to help capture and determine a form's parameters.

You can also `inspect element` and have a look at what is being sent over the network. In this case, you can put in some dummy / random input into the login and password sections to see how they are being sent over the network. You will find that often it will look like this `username=test&password=test`.

You can also capture the request as a `curl` statement and then paste that into the terminal to have a look. `(Copy > Copy as cURL)`
